---

## üí° Common Interview Questions & Quick Answers

### "How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?"

**Formula:** Risk = Exploitability √ó Impact √ó Asset Value / Compensating Controls

**Factors:**
1. CVSS score
2. Public exploit available?
3. Production vs. dev
4. Data exposure type (PII, payment data)
5. Compliance requirements
6. Compensating controls

### "How do you balance security and velocity?"

**Key Points:**
- Security is an enabler, not a blocker
- Risk-based decisions (not all vulnerabilities block launch)
- Shift left (find issues early)
- Self-service security tools
- Provide solutions, not just problems
- Compensating controls when needed

### "How do you scale security across hundreds of teams?"

**Strategies:**
1. **Self-service tools** (don't review everything yourself)
2. **Security Champions** (1 per team)
3. **Automation** (security in CI/CD)
4. **Templates** (secure starter kits)
5. **Training** (enable developers)
6. **Metrics** (measure and improve)

## üö® Incident Response Framework

1. **Detection & Analysis** (0-15 min)
   - Verify and assess impact
   - Initiate incident response

2. **Containment** (15-60 min)
   - Apply temporary mitigations (WAF, rate limiting)
   - Monitor for active exploitation
   - Preserve evidence

3. **Eradication** (1-4 hours)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Deploy to production
   - Verify fix works

4. **Recovery** (4-24 hours)
   - Remove temporary mitigations
   - Assess damage
   - User impact mitigation

5. **Post-Incident** (1-7 days)
   - Root cause analysis (5 Whys)
   - Regulatory notifications
   - Post-mortem document
   - Preventive measures
